In [part 1](/2024/fall/computer-science/assignments/flappy-bird-1), you setup Pygame and defined a function to draw a bird. In this assignment you will add the logic to move the bird!

- Create a constant to define the "gravity" affecting the bird
- Create variables to track the bird's position
- Create a variable to track the bird's velocity
- Handle keypress to make the bird "flap"
- Update the bird's velocity
- Update the bird's position based on its velocity
- Change where the bird is drawn based on its position

## Project Structure

Remember to organize your project like you did in [part 1](/2024/fall/computer-science/assignments/flappy-bird-1#project-structure):

- Import modules
- Define constants
- Define functions
- Define game variables
- Initialize Pygame
- Main game loop
