A classic first program to test that your toolchain (runtime environment, compiler, <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr>, etc.) is set up properly is the "Hello, World!" program.

> ...the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book The C Programming Language...

See [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to read more about it.

Navigate to the online Python editor at [run-python-online.com](https://run-python-online.com/) and type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Press the "Run" button to execute the code. Below the editor, you will see the the program output. It should have printed "Hello, World!"

> The term "printing" in computer programming originates from the early days of computing, when output was often produced on physical printers. In the 1950s and 1960s, computers used line printers, which printed output on paper, line by line. Programmers would write code to "print" output to the printer, which would then produce a physical printout of the results.

Download a copy of your code by pressing the "Download" button. The file will be saved with the extension `.py`. This file is also known as a "script" or "source code".

Upload the `.py` file to the "Hello, World!" assignment in ThinkWave. You've just completed your first programming project! 🎉
