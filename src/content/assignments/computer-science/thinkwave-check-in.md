### Step One: Log in to ThinkWave

You should be able to login to [ThinkWave](https://www.thinkwave.com/) and see your class list.

### Step Two: Take a Screenshot

To make sure everything in ThinkWave is hooked up, please save a screenshot of your class list or dashboard.

Knowing how to take a screenshot will be important if there ever comes a time that you need help with an assignment.

### Step Three: Send Me an Email

Turn in your assignment by sending me an email at [rylanschubkegel@gmail.com](mailto:rylanschubkegel@gmail.com). Make sure to attach your screenshot to the message! Email is the primary way you can communicate with me throughout the semester.

Please send the message **from your student email**. This email will be used for additional platforms required for this class (Google Form submissions, JDoodle, etc.).
