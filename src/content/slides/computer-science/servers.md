### How is a Server Unique?

- Purpose <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Hardware <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Operating System <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

NOTES:
- A server provides services and resources to clients over a network
- Typically very powerful, often redundant components such as power supplies and hard drives to ensure high availability
- Usually run Windows Server or Linux instead of Windows or MacOS

--

### Clients

A client is a computer or software that requests and receives services, resources, or data from a server.

### What is "The Cloud?"

A model of delivering computing services over the internet.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

### What Does That Mean?

The cloud is a **_collection of servers_** that work together to provide software or other resources.

--

### Common Categories of Services

- Software as a Service (SaaS) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

NOTES:
- Provides software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, configure, and maintain software on their own devices
- Provides a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications, including tools, libraries, and infrastructure
- Provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking

--

### Common Cloud Services

- Storage (Dropbox, Google Drive) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social Media (Instagram, Facebook, X) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Communication (Slack, Discord) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

### Myth: The cloud is a giant single entity

The cloud is a collection of servers, not a single entity.
